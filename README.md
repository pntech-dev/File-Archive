## What's New (v4.2.0)

### ✨ New Features
- **Added support for PDF instructions**  
  Now you can attach files with instructions in **PDF** format to groups of versions.

- **Added “Open Instruction” button**  
  Instruction files can now be opened **directly from the application**, without navigating to their folder manually.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed a table refresh issue**  
  In some cases, the table did not update correctly after certain user actions. This behavior has now been resolved.

- **Fixed incorrect display of instruction file extensions**  
  The file extension for instruction documents was sometimes shown incorrectly. This display logic has been corrected.

- **Fixed an issue where the interface remained disabled after uploading a file**  
  A UI state-lock bug caused the interface to stay unresponsive after uploading a version or instruction. This is now fixed.

- **Fixed incorrect notification behavior after deleting a group**  
  Notifications were sometimes displayed incorrectly following the deletion of a version group. This issue has been corrected.

## 📥 Download workflow

1. Select a product by clicking once in the table  
   (the latest available version is selected automatically)

2. Optional: double-click a product to open version listing  
   and select **any previous version** if it was uploaded earlier

3. Choose a save location:  
   - by default, the file will be downloaded to the Desktop  
   - or a custom folder can be selected

4. Click **Download**  
   The selected version is decrypted and saved to the chosen destination

This workflow allows engineers to retrieve current releases  
and operators to safely download only approved versions.

## 📌 Overview

**File Archive** provides a secure and structured way to store, update, distribute, and retrieve versioned project files and technical documentation.  

The application ensures data confidentiality using user-generated cryptographic keys and supports different access modes for engineers and production personnel. 

Designed for environments where controlled access, integrity, and up-to-date versions, secure distribution is critical.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone ...
cd File Archive
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔑 Key generation & initialization

1. Run the key generation script: `python generate_keyfiles.py`
1. A `config.yaml` file is created based on `config_template.yaml`
2. Keys are stored locally and never committed
3. Application can now operate securely
   
---

## 🏗 Building (optional)

The application can be packaged using PyInstaller with the provided spec:

```bash
pyinstaller "File Archive.spec"
```
